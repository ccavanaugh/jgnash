== jGnash README

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgnash/[jGnash] is a free (no strings attached!) personal finance manager with many
of the same features as commercially-available software. It was created in order to make tracking your personal finances
easy, but also provides the functionality required by advanced users. jGnash is cross-platform: jGnash 2 will run on
any operating system that has a working Java Runtime Environment (e.g., Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows)

jGnash 2.x requires that the Java Platform version 8 or newer be installed.
jGnash has been tested with the Oracle JVM as well as the open source OpenJDK Platform.

=== Getting Java

Most users of jGnash will want the latest version of http://www.java.com/en/download/[Oracle Java Runtime Environment].

Developers will want the Java Development Kit (see build instructions below.)

=== Learn about jGnash

To learn about the features of jGnash, visit the https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgnash/[jGnash Website].

=== Download jGnash

You can download jGnash from the https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgnash/files/Active%20Stable%202.x/[jGnash Download Page].

=== To Install jGnash:

. Unzip all files into a directory of your choice leaving the directory structure unchanged.

=== To Run:

Executable files are provided for Windows and UN*X users at the root of the installation directory.
The jGnashFx executables will launch jGnash with the latest interface and the jGnash2 files with launch jGnash with
the old legacy Java Swing interface.

Simply double click on the *.exe file of choice in Windows.

UN*X users can start jGnash with the provided Bash scripts.  If they fail to launch, check your file permissions and
make sure they are set to be executable or use a unzip tool that preserves file permissions.

An example for UN*X users is show below assuming you have changed to the installation directory.

./jGnashFx

==== OpenJDK Tips:

If you are using the OpenJDK, enabling OpenGL acceleration can significantly improve
graphics performance. See the integrated help for use of the `-opengl` option.

==== Linux Tips:

jGnash is not compatible with the GCJ Java installation pre-installed on older Linux distributions.
You will need to install the OpenJDK or Oracle Java Platform and correctly set the default for jGnash
to operate correctly.

==== Mac OS X Installation:

For Mac OS X users, a minimum of Mac OS X 10.8.3 is required

. Copy the jGnash folder to `/Applications` and remove the version so the final path looks like `/Applications/jGnash`.
. Open the AppleScript Editor.

Create the following script:

[source]
----
try
    do shell script "/Applications/jGnash/jGnashFx"
end try
----

Save it as an Application called `jGnash.app` in `/Applications/jGnash`

=== Java 9 Requirements
jGnash 2.x is designed to operate with Java 8.

An additional command line option `--add-modules java.xml.bind` is required if you want to operate under Java 9.

An illegal reflective access Warning will be displayed on the console similar to the following.  It may be ignored and
should improve at a later date as the Java Ecosystem migrates to Java 9.

==== NOTES:

When upgrading from 1.x to 2.x, you will have to recreate your reminders.

See the integrated help for command line options.

=== Building jGnash:

Gradle is used as the primary build system for jGnash.  The Gradle Wrapper is included so that you do not need to
install Gradle.  The Wrapper will automatically download the necessary dependencies.

[NOTE]
Depending on your OS (almost always Windows and OSX) the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files for Java 8
are needed for the unit tests to complete correctly.  If you do not want to install these files or are
restricted by your locale, modify the test build or disable tests.  jGnash uses encryption for client / server
communication and unit tests are performed to prevent regressions.

To build jGnash you'll need the following software installed and correctly configured on your system:

. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK 8u71] or later.

_If you are building with a recent 64 bit Linux system, you may need to enable Multilib/32 Bit support capabilities.
Otherwise, the Gradle build may fail when building the windows executables._

To create the distribution zip file, start at the main directory and run:

Building on Windows

[source]
----
gradlew clean distZip
----

Building on UN*X

[source]
----
./gradlew clean distZip
----

A distributable zip file will be produced at the root of the build directory called jGnash-_version_-bin.zip.

== jGnashFx Version

The distribution now contains a version of jGnash that utilizes JavaFX for the user interface. Long term this version
will replace the Java Swing based version that jGnash was first based on. The advantages of JavaFX over Swing are an
improved appearance with better utilization of the systems graphics hardware including Hi-DPI systems.

The core/engine of jGnash remains the same and is shared by both the Swing and JavaFx versions. This means stability
and protection of your valuable data remains the same. This also allows you to switch between versions without issue.

The advantages for jGnash is a smaller code base for the user interface, access to better components such as improved
table support, HTML pages, functional animations, modern controls, etc. Experienced jGnash users will notice
interface improvements. For example, try using the vertical and horizontal scroll wheels in a date picker and the
collapsible transaction forms.

=== Java 8 Requirements

https://jdk8.java.net/download.html[JDK 8u71] or later is required for the jGnashFx interface. The 8u71 release
fixed several JavaFX bugs and jGnashFx is dependent on several recent API changes.

=== Linux Users

Linux users may use the jGnashFx interface if you have the Oracle release of Java installed or if you are
using OpenJDK with OpenJFX 8u71 or later installed. OpenJFX 8u40 and u45 packages are generally available for most
mainstream distributions, but will not work.

=== OpenJFX

jGnashFx has been heavily tested against OpenJFX. There are no noticeable differences in performance or
stability with the Oracle release or OpenJDK with OpenJFX.
