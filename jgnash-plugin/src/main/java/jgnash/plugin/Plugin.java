/**
 * This is the interface for jGnash application plugins.
 * <p>
 * Plugins can install multiple menu items into the primary UI. Any returned {@code JMenuItem}s must have the
 * client property {@code PRECEDINGMENUIDREF} set for the menu item to installed correctly.
 * <p>
 * The available preceding id for installation may be found in {@code main-frame-actions.xml} in the
 * {@code jgnash.resource} package.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * {@code
 * JMenuItem item = new JMenuItem("Test Plugin");
 * <p>
 * item.putClientProperty(Plugin.PRECEDINGMENUIDREF, "paste-command");
 * }
 * <p>
 * The above example will install a menu item after <tt>Paste</tt> in the <tt>Edit</tt> menu.
